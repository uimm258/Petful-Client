### Summary/Instructions
As a pet lover, I want to visit the FIFO pet adoption site so that I can get more information about the adoption process. 

This app is intended to help users sign up to adopt a pet. It follows a first come first serve approach in where the new users are added to the bottom of a queue to await their turn. Once the new user is at the top of the queue, the user may select between adopting a cat or a dog. 

### User Story
As a visitor/user:
* I want to enter my name to join the waiting list 
* I want to see the dogs and cats
* I want to adopt a dog or a cat whenever it's my turn
